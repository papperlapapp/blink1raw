# blink1raw enhanced

This is an enhanced version of blink1raw from
https://github.com/todbot/blink1.git.

As of today (Jan 2015), the original blink1raw works with an blink(1)-mk2, but
restricts itself to the feature set of the mk1 version. This enhanced version
supports the new features of the mk2 while maintaining backwards compatibility
with the original tool.
